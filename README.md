# 🎮 Cyber Hunter 2026

**Cyber Hunter 2026** is a fast-paced reflex game built with **Python** and **Tkinter**.
Your goal is simple: **click the moving target**, level up, and reach **100 points** before you run out of lives.

---

## 🧠 Game Concept

* A target 👾 appears at random positions on the screen
* Clicking the target increases your score
* Missing the target costs you a life
* The game gets faster as you level up
* Reach **100 points** to win

---

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the game
2. Click on the 👾 target as fast as possible
3. Avoid clicking anywhere else on the screen
4. Survive and score until you win — or lose all lives

## 🎯 Game Rules

* **Score**:
  +1 point for every successful click

* **Lives**:
  Start with **5 lives**
  −1 life for every missed click

* **Levels**:
  Every **5 points** → level increases
  Higher levels = faster target movement

* **Win Condition**:
  Reach **100 points**

* **Lose Condition**:
  Lives drop to **0**
